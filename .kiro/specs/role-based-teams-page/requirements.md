# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements role-based access control and different views for the teams page based on user roles (ADMIN, REF, COMMON). Each role will have different permissions and see different information when accessing the teams page, ensuring appropriate access levels while maintaining security and usability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an ADMIN user, I want full CRUD operations on teams and import/export functionality, so that I can manage all teams in the system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an ADMIN user accesses the teams page THEN the system SHALL display all teams with full management capabilities
2. WHEN an ADMIN user clicks create team THEN the system SHALL allow creation of new teams
3. WHEN an ADMIN user selects a team THEN the system SHALL allow editing of team information
4. WHEN an ADMIN user clicks delete on a team THEN the system SHALL allow removal of teams with confirmation
5. WHEN an ADMIN user clicks import THEN the system SHALL display CSV import functionality
6. WHEN an ADMIN user clicks export THEN the system SHALL generate and download team data as CSV
7. WHEN an ADMIN user views team details THEN the system SHALL show all team information including sensitive data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a REF (referee) user, I want to view all team information without modification capabilities, so that I can access necessary data for officiating without risking accidental changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a REF user accesses the teams page THEN the system SHALL display all teams in read-only mode
2. WHEN a REF user views team details THEN the system SHALL show all team information except sensitive administrative data
3. WHEN a REF user attempts to access CRUD operations THEN the system SHALL hide or disable these controls
4. WHEN a REF user attempts to access import/export functions THEN the system SHALL hide these options
5. WHEN a REF user views the leaderboard THEN the system SHALL display all filtering and sorting capabilities

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a COMMON user, I want to see only my own team's information and basic details of other teams, so that I can view relevant information without accessing sensitive data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a COMMON user accesses the teams page THEN the system SHALL display only their registered team and limited information about other teams
2. WHEN a COMMON user views their own team THEN the system SHALL show full team details including member information
3. WHEN a COMMON user views other teams THEN the system SHALL show only basic public information (name, organization)
4. WHEN a COMMON user attempts to access CRUD operations THEN the system SHALL hide these controls completely
5. WHEN a COMMON user attempts to access import/export functions THEN the system SHALL hide these options
6. WHEN a COMMON user has no registered team THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating they are not part of any team

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want role-based access to be enforced at both frontend and backend levels, so that security is maintained even if frontend controls are bypassed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any user makes an API request THEN the system SHALL validate their role and permissions on the backend
2. WHEN an unauthorized user attempts a restricted operation THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses
3. WHEN the frontend loads THEN the system SHALL fetch user role information and configure the UI accordingly
4. IF a user's role changes during their session THEN the system SHALL update the UI permissions appropriately
5. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN the system SHALL enforce role-based access control at the controller level

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user with any role, I want the interface to clearly indicate what actions I can perform, so that I understand my permissions and don't encounter unexpected errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the teams page THEN the system SHALL display only the controls and options available to their role
2. WHEN a user hovers over disabled functionality THEN the system SHALL provide tooltips explaining permission requirements
3. WHEN a user's role has limited access THEN the system SHALL display appropriate messaging about their access level
4. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL show a clear indication of the user's current role and associated permissions
5. IF a user attempts an unauthorized action THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages explaining the restriction
