# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current WebSocket system has grown overly complex with multiple layers of abstraction, overlapping responsibilities, and intricate state management that leads to bugs and maintenance difficulties. This refactor aims to simplify the architecture while maintaining all existing functionality, improving reliability, and making the codebase more maintainable.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simplified WebSocket architecture, so that I can easily understand, debug, and maintain the real-time communication system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the WebSocket system is refactored THEN it SHALL have a clear separation of concerns with single responsibility principle
2. WHEN examining the codebase THEN each component SHALL have one primary responsibility (connection, events, state, or roles)
3. WHEN debugging issues THEN the data flow SHALL be traceable through no more than 3 layers of abstraction
4. WHEN adding new features THEN developers SHALL be able to identify the correct component to modify within 5 minutes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want reliable WebSocket connections, so that real-time features work consistently without connection drops or state desynchronization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the WebSocket connection is lost THEN the system SHALL automatically reconnect with exponential backoff
2. WHEN reconnection occurs THEN the system SHALL restore the previous state without data loss
3. WHEN multiple users are connected THEN state changes SHALL be synchronized across all clients within 1 second
4. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL maintain local state and sync when connection is restored
5. WHEN connection status changes THEN all dependent components SHALL be notified immediately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a match referee, I want precise timer control, so that match timing is accurate and synchronized across all displays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the timer is started THEN all connected clients SHALL receive the update within 100ms
2. WHEN the timer is running THEN the displayed time SHALL be accurate to within 100ms across all clients
3. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the timer SHALL continue running locally and sync when reconnected
4. WHEN period transitions occur THEN all clients SHALL update the match period simultaneously
5. WHEN the timer reaches zero THEN the match status SHALL automatically update to completed

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a scoring operator, I want real-time score updates, so that all displays show current scores immediately without delays or conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scores are updated THEN all connected displays SHALL reflect changes within 500ms
2. WHEN multiple users update scores simultaneously THEN the system SHALL resolve conflicts using role-based priority
3. WHEN score updates are made THEN only changed values SHALL be transmitted to optimize bandwidth
4. WHEN connection is restored THEN the latest score state SHALL be synchronized automatically
5. WHEN invalid score data is received THEN the system SHALL reject it and maintain data integrity

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a tournament director, I want role-based access control, so that only authorized users can perform specific actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts an action THEN the system SHALL verify their role permissions before allowing it
2. WHEN user roles change THEN their access permissions SHALL update immediately
3. WHEN unauthorized actions are attempted THEN the system SHALL log the attempt and deny access
4. WHEN role permissions are checked THEN the response SHALL be returned within 50ms
5. WHEN multiple roles have overlapping permissions THEN the highest privilege level SHALL take precedence

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want simplified event handling, so that I can easily subscribe to and emit WebSocket events without complex configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN subscribing to events THEN the API SHALL require only the event name and callback function
2. WHEN emitting events THEN the API SHALL accept event name and data with optional configuration
3. WHEN events are filtered THEN the filtering logic SHALL be centralized and reusable
4. WHEN event handlers are removed THEN all associated resources SHALL be cleaned up automatically
5. WHEN debugging events THEN developers SHALL be able to trace event flow with clear logging

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system user, I want optimal performance with minimized WebSocket requests, so that the system is efficient while maintaining correctness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple rapid events occur THEN the system SHALL debounce them to prevent flooding while ensuring data accuracy
2. WHEN large amounts of data are transmitted THEN only necessary changes SHALL be sent using delta updates
3. WHEN duplicate events are detected THEN the system SHALL filter them out before transmission
4. WHEN the system is idle THEN WebSocket connections SHALL use minimal resources with heartbeat optimization
5. WHEN performance is measured THEN event processing SHALL complete within 10ms on average
6. WHEN optimizing requests THEN the system SHALL batch compatible events together without losing data integrity
7. WHEN reducing network traffic THEN the system SHALL compress payloads while maintaining real-time responsiveness

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling, so that WebSocket failures don't crash the application or leave it in an inconsistent state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN WebSocket errors occur THEN they SHALL be caught and handled gracefully
2. WHEN connection failures happen THEN users SHALL be notified with clear error messages
3. WHEN invalid data is received THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue operating
4. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic recovery
5. WHEN errors are logged THEN they SHALL include sufficient context for debugging

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a quality assurance tester, I want testable WebSocket components, so that I can verify functionality and prevent regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing tests THEN each WebSocket component SHALL be independently testable
2. WHEN mocking WebSocket connections THEN tests SHALL be able to simulate various network conditions
3. WHEN testing event flows THEN the system SHALL provide hooks for test verification
4. WHEN running integration tests THEN WebSocket functionality SHALL be verifiable end-to-end
5. WHEN testing error conditions THEN the system SHALL allow injection of failure scenarios
