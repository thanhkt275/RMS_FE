# Score Configuration Unassign UI Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds comprehensive unassign functionality to the Score Configuration management system, allowing ADMIN users to quickly assign and unassign score-config profiles from tournaments both in the table view and directly within the form editor.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced ScoreConfigTable
- **Dynamic Action Menu**: The actions dropdown now shows different options based on assignment status:
  - If assigned: Shows "Unassign from Tournament" option with UserMinus icon
  - If unassigned: Shows "Assign to Tournament" option with UserPlus icon
- **Visual Status Indicators**: Clear badges showing "Assigned" or "Unassigned" status
- **One-Click Unassignment**: Direct unassign functionality from the table without additional dialogs

### 2. Quick Assignment Section in ScoreConfigForm
- **Tournament Assignment Panel**: New dedicated section in the form editor for existing configurations
- **Real-time Status Display**: Shows current assignment status with appropriate styling:
  - Green panel with checkmark for assigned configurations
  - Gray panel with warning icon for unassigned configurations
- **Quick Action Buttons**: 
  - "Unassign" button for assigned configurations
  - "Quick Assign" button for unassigned configurations (opens assignment dialog)
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during assign/unassign operations

### 3. Enhanced Main Page Logic
- **Unassign Handler**: Integrated unassign functionality with toast notifications
- **Quick Assignment Handlers**: Simplified assignment workflow from the form
- **Tournament Data Integration**: Automatic fetching and passing of tournament data
- **Error Handling**: Proper error states and user feedback

## Technical Implementation

### Components Modified
1. **ScoreConfigTable.tsx**
   - Added `onUnassign` prop
   - Updated action menu logic
   - Added UserMinus icon import

2. **ScoreConfigForm.tsx**
   - Added quick assignment section
   - Extended props interface for assignment handlers
   - Added tournament assignment status display
   - Integrated loading states

3. **src/app/score-config/page.tsx**
   - Added unassign mutation handler
   - Added quick assignment handlers
   - Added tournament data fetching
   - Enhanced error handling with toast notifications

### API Integration
- Updated `useScoreConfig` hook's `unassign` mutation to use proper backend endpoint
- Uses `DELETE /score-configs/:id/assign-tournament` endpoint as defined in the backend service
- Integrates with `useTournaments` hook for tournament data
- Maintains consistency with existing assignment workflow
- Proper error handling and toast notifications

## User Experience Enhancements

### Visual Feedback
- **Color-coded Status**: Green for assigned, gray for unassigned
- **Loading Indicators**: Spinners during operations
- **Toast Notifications**: Success/error messages for user actions
- **Contextual Icons**: Visual cues for different states and actions

### Workflow Improvements
- **Reduced Clicks**: Direct unassign from table
- **Contextual Actions**: Different options based on current state
- **Quick Assignment**: Streamlined assignment process from form
- **Clear Status**: Always visible assignment status

## Code Quality Features

### Type Safety
- Extended `ScoreConfigFormValues` with optional `id` field
- Proper TypeScript support for all new handlers
- Type-safe prop interfaces

### Error Handling
- Toast notifications for success/error states
- Graceful handling of missing tournament data
- Proper loading state management

### Maintainability
- Consistent with existing code patterns
- Reusable component structure
- Clean separation of concerns

## Usage Instructions

### For Table Operations
1. Open Score Configuration page
2. Locate configuration in table
3. Click actions menu (â‹¯)
4. Select "Assign to Tournament" or "Unassign from Tournament" based on current status

### For Form Operations
1. Edit an existing score configuration
2. Navigate to "Tournament Assignment" section
3. Use "Quick Assign" or "Unassign" button as appropriate
4. For assignment, select tournament in the dialog that opens

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- Confirmation dialogs for unassign operations
- Bulk assignment/unassignment functionality
- Tournament name display in assigned configurations
- Assignment history tracking
- Advanced filtering by assignment status

### Accessibility Considerations
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- High contrast mode support
- Focus management during operations

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Scenarios
1. Assign configuration from table
2. Unassign configuration from table
3. Quick assign from form
4. Quick unassign from form
5. Form state persistence during operations
6. Error handling with network issues
7. Loading states during operations

### Edge Cases
- No tournaments available
- Assignment failures
- Concurrent modifications
- Form validation during assignment operations

This implementation provides a comprehensive and user-friendly solution for managing score configuration assignments, enhancing the admin experience while maintaining code quality and consistency with the existing system architecture.
